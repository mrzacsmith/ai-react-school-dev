    <div className="App">
      <JuneCalendar />

## Styling

## Notes
- The `JuneCalendar` component is static and does not handle any user interactions or state management.
- It is designed to be a simple, read-only display of the month of June.

## Example Implementation
Here is an example implementation of the `JuneCalendar` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const JuneCalendar = () => {
  const daysOfWeek = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'];
  const daysInJune = Array.from({ length: 30 }, (_, i) => i + 1);

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">June Calendar</h2>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-7 gap-2">
        {daysOfWeek.map((day) => (
          <div key={day} className="font-semibold text-center">
            {day}
          </div>
        ))}
        {daysInJune.map((date) => (
          <div key={date} className="text-center border p-2">
            {date}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default JuneCalendar;
```

In this implementation:
- The `daysOfWeek` array contains the names of the days of the week.
- The `daysInJune` array is generated using `Array.from` to create an array of numbers from 1 to 30.
- The component renders a grid layout using TailwindCSS classes, displaying the days of the week and the dates of June.

## TailwindCSS Setup
If you haven't set up TailwindCSS in your project, you can follow the official [TailwindCSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to get started.

## Conclusion
The `JuneCalendar` component is a simple, static calendar for the month of June. It is styled using TailwindCSS and does not require any additional dependencies or properties. This component can be easily integrated into your React application to display a read-only calendar for June.
